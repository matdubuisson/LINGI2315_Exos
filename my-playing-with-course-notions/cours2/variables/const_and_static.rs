// const:

//     Have no fixed address in memory
//     Theyâ€™re inlined to each place which uses them, this means they are put directly into the binary on the places which use them.
//     Usually faster runtime but bigger executable file because it doesn't have to look up an address like static

// static:

//     Have a fixed address in memory
//     Their value is loaded from this fixed address each place which uses them.
//     Usually slower runtime because we need to perform the extra instruction of loading the data from the fixed address. However this could result in a smaller executable file (only when it is used frequently) because it doesn't have to have multiple copies of the value baked into the executable.
